## My Goal

I am going to use Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) to grab live data from the internet. If you’re dreaming of making that weather app then you’re about add some serious tools to your toolbelt!


## What I will create

I will have a dark-mode enabled weather app. You'll be able to check the weather for the current location based on the GPS data from the iPhone as well as by searching for a city manually.
